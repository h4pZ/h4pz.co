summary: Gallery in commemoration of the international BSOD day

On 2024-07-19 there was a [major windows BSOD issue](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201717/windows-bsod-crowdstrike-outage-issue) as a result of an update from [crowdstrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/). This led to more than 8 million computers across the globe into a boot loop with BSOD that affected organisations like banks and airports. Lots of people got a free day from work because their work laptop suffered from this boot loop (I didn't because my work laptop is a mac).

This is the Y2K we never got. Given the eeriness of the whole situation, I've collected a small set of images to remember the day the world learnt the power of a white on blue sad emoticon <span style="background-color: #0079D9; color: white;">:(</span>.
